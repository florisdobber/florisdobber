# Hi, I'm Floris ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Science major at Northeastern University, graduating in May 2023. 
Currently I am working as a data engineering intern at [FINN](https://www.finn.auto/en-US), a car subscription company aiming to make mobility fun and sustainable. 
In my free time I lead [Code4Community](https://c4cneu.com/), a software development organization dedicated to providing industry-grade software to local non-profits at no cost. 
I recently completed my co-op working at [LineVision](https://www.linevisioninc.com/) as a data engineer, working on finding novel solutions to provide real time analytics to utility companies. Our products directly enabled utility companies to manage the grid more efficiently, thereby providing the capacity necessary to ensure a more sustainable future. 
Previously, I worked at [Eaton Vance](https://www.eatonvance.com/) as a Global Quantitative Data Analyst on their Global Income team. I wrote NLP algorithms to analyze thousands of articles on a daily basis to help fuel investment decisions in addition to building interactive dashboards to give managers an overview of the current status of their portfolio.
