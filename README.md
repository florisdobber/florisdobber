# Hi, I'm Floris ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Science major at Northeastern University, graduating in May 2023. 
I recently completed my co-op working as a data engineering intern at [FINN](https://www.finn.auto/en-US), the fastest growing car subscription company in Europe. My work enabled all reporting and data analysis within FINN, powering everything from investor reports to internal KPIs to churn analysis. 
Previously, I worked at [LineVision](https://www.linevisioninc.com/) as a data engineer, working on finding novel solutions to provide real time analytics to utility companies. Our products directly enabled utility companies to manage the grid more efficiently, thereby providing the capacity necessary to ensure a more sustainable future. 
Before that, I worked at [Eaton Vance](https://www.eatonvance.com/) as a quantitative data analyst on their Global Income team. I wrote NLP algorithms to analyze thousands of articles on a daily basis to help fuel investment decisions in addition to building interactive dashboards to give managers an overview of the current status of their portfolio.
