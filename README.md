# Hi, I'm Floris

I'm a Data Science major at Northeastern University, graduating in May 2023. Currently, I'm working on creating a platform dedicated to mapping and maintaining Boston's urban forest in partnership with [Speak for the Trees](https://www.sfttbos.org/). Previously, I worked at [Eaton Vance](https://www.eatonvance.com/) as a Global Quantitative Data Analyst on their Global Income team. I wrote NLP algorithms to analyze thousands of articles on a daily basis to help fuel investment decisions in addition to building interactive dashboards that give managers an overview of the current status of their portfolio. I'm seeking a 2021 summer and fall internship or co-op, so please reach out to me here or on any of the platforms below if you want to connect!
